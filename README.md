# CorneaSim
MATLAB Simulation of corneal homeostasis

# Files to run
EquipotentSim.m  and  HierarchicalSim.m are the main files that run the simulation(documentation and examples inside)

# Additional files
4 div_mat_start_DATA for different pertubation files that contain 'div_mat_start_DATA' table with the following colums:
1- bias degree, 2- index, 3- Coupled(1) or uncoupled(0), 4-RLS, 5- 203X203 matrix that contains steady-state map of cellular devision to innitialize the simulation to start from a steady state.
